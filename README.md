# The IDEAFast ID Generation tool

## Local development

### Requirements

First things first, there's always something before you can start.

To make our life easier, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) a lot. Make sure you have it installed.

### Build the library

Building the library is easy. First run `yarn install && yarn run build`, to build the application. Artifacts will be rendered in the `/dist` folder as the root of your clone.
